## Overview

D-Project is a backend-focused ERP management system designed for degree colleges. This project was created to manage and streamline various processes such as student library entry/exit tracking and document/note sharing. Built entirely using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **MongoDB**, this backend API provides essential endpoints for managing institutional workflows.

> Note: This project was developed before I learned frontend development. API requests and responses were tested using **Thunder Client**.

## Key Features

- **Library Entry & Exit Tracking**: APIs to record and monitor students' library check-ins and check-outs.
- **Document Sharing System**: Allows faculty and staff to share important documents, which are stored securely in the database.
- **Notes Sharing**: A system to upload and store notes in MongoDB, making them easily retrievable via API calls.
- **Role-based API Routes**: Separate routes and permissions for different types of users like students, faculty, and admin.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application logic and REST API.
- **Express.js**: To define routing and middleware for handling various endpoints.
- **MongoDB**: As the database solution for storing student records, notes, and shared documents.
- **Thunder Client**: Used to test all backend API requests during development.

## Challenges and Learnings

Since this was my early backend project, one of the main challenges was learning how to structure RESTful APIs effectively. Additionally, managing data models in MongoDB and implementing CRUD operations taught me core concepts of backend engineering. I also learned the importance of testing APIs thoroughly before integrating them with a frontend.

## Outcome

D-Project provided me with a solid foundation in backend development and API design. While it was built without a frontend at the time, it successfully handled critical ERP functions like student tracking and document management. This project was a stepping stone that prepared me for building full-stack applications later on.
